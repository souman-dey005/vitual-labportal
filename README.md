## Vision
The `VirtualLabManager` contract is designed to facilitate a decentralized platform for managing virtual labs and tracking user achievements in the fields of science and engineering. The goal is to provide a transparent, immutable system for lab registration, user access management, and achievement recording, enabling seamless and secure educational experiences.
